This open-source project leverages reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to automate and optimize the process of managing investment portfolios. In the world of finance, making informed decisions about asset allocation is crucial for maximizing returns while minimizing risk. Our project offers a powerful solution for achieving this balance.

Key Features:

Customizable RL Environment: Our custom Gym-based environment simulates financial markets, allowing RL agents to interact with historical data to make portfolio allocation decisions.

Flexibility: Users can tailor various aspects of the environment and RL algorithms, including initial capital, time windows, feature selection, normalization methods, and more.

Evaluation and Visualization: We provide tools for evaluating the performance of portfolio allocation strategies and visualizing results to gain insights.

Realistic Simulation: The project supports modeling commission fees, giving you a more realistic view of transaction costs in the financial world.

Documentation and Examples: Extensive documentation and example code make it easy to get started with RL-based portfolio optimization.
